# Robot-control-system2
To approach this interface:
1. First, I've added 5 buttons (Left,right,forward,backward, and stop).
2. Second, I've connect each button with a page that shows the move with the first letter of the movement button (L,R,S,F,B).
3. Then, I've build a database with one table that had 5 columns each one represents a button with a data type VARCHAR, so when the user click a button it should saved in the database as a the first letter of the buttons name.
